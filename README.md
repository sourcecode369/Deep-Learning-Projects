# Deep-Learning-Projects
#### This repository contains Jupyter Notebook Files of all the projects that I completed during my summer internship online program in deeplearning.ai (Coursera). 

#### The project files are divided into 5 main categories or respective courses that the deeplearning.ai provides.

#### Course instructor Andrew Ng has helped me understand deepLearning and I would highly recommend this course to anyone intersted in the field of AI and Deeplearning. 

## The Courses Include: 

1. > Neural Networks and Deep Learning

2. > Improving Deep Neural Network Hyperparameters

3. > Structured Machine Learning Projects

4. > Convolutional Neural Networks

5. > Sequence Models ( Not Completed )
